# GitHub Issues Planning Snapshot

> This file is generated from GitHub Issues when `gh issue list` is available. Markdown planning files remain snapshots; GitHub Issues are the canonical task state once enabled.

## Status

- GitHub Issues snapshot unavailable in this environment.
- Reason: gh: To use GitHub CLI in a GitHub Actions workflow, set the GH_TOKEN environment variable. Example:
  env:
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
